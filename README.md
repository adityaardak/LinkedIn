# KL Divergence Example

This project provides a simple demonstration of calculating Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence between two probability distributions. KL Divergence is a measure of how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution. This concept is useful in understanding information loss when approximating or substituting one distribution with another.


## Usage

The `main.py` script defines two sample probability distributions (`P` and `Q`) and calculates the KL Divergence between them.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy library**

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:
pip install numpy

## Execution
To execute the script, navigate to the kl_divergence_example directory and run:

## Concept
P: Represents the "expected" distribution.
Q: Represents the "actual" observed distribution.
The script computes the divergence of Q from P. A lower value of KL Divergence indicates that the distributions are more similar.
