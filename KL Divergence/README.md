# KL Divergence Example

This project provides a simple demonstration of calculating Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence between two probability distributions. KL Divergence is a measure of how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution. This concept is useful in understanding information loss when approximating or substituting one distribution with another.


## Usage

The `main.py` script defines two sample probability distributions (`P` and `Q`) and calculates the KL Divergence between them.
Visualize distributions using visualize.py

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy library**
- **Matplotlib library**
- **Scipy Library**

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy

## Execution
To execute the script, navigate to the kl_divergence_example directory and run:

## Concept
P: Represents the "expected" distribution.
Q: Represents the "actual" observed distribution.
The script computes the divergence of Q from P. A lower value of KL Divergence indicates that the distributions are more similar.



**Visualization**
The visualize.py script creates a bar chart that compares the two probability distributions. Each category is represented by a pair of bars, where one bar represents the "expected" probability and the other represents the "actual" probability.

This visualization helps to identify where the largest differences between the two distributions lie, giving you a clearer understanding of what contributes to the KL Divergence value.
